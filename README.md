# Reproject-Vector-and-raster-layers
This Python script automates reprojecting selected vector and raster layers in QGIS to a user-defined CRS. It uses the "Reproject Layer" and "Assign Projection" tools, reprojecting layers and adding them as temporary layers, ideal for standardizing spatial data.
